- Reviews are stored and can be searched by people. This is done by searching the beer which will then give a list of all reviews for that beer
- Reviews can be interacted with by other users, i.e. thumbs up reaction
- An admin user can moderate comments and post by having the power to remove posts, remove accounts and remove incorrect beer info from the database
